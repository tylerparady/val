    I love you so much. You make my entire world brighter just by being in it. Im so happy that you chose me, and im even happier that I get to talk to you and spend all my time with you every single day. Thank you for always staying with me and for caring and being patient with me. Thank you for being my safe space always. You let me be myself and open up like nobody else ever can. I hope you know how much you mean to me. With everyday I spend with you I hope you realize how much I love you. You're my whole entire world and the best part of my life. 
    I love you more than I can ever fit into words
